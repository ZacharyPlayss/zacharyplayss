ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm an enthusiastic 21-year-old Application Development student at Karel de Grote University of Applied Sciences and Arts. I'm passionate about building creative solutions and evolving my skills in software development.

ðŸŽ’ My journey so far has involved working on a variety of school projects, but I also love diving into personal side projects. One of my favorite creations is my portfolio website https://zacharyvds.be/, where you can explore my ongoing projects and read my thoughts on different development topics through my so called "Development Journey" blog.

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m constantly learning and experimenting with new tools and technologies, which helps me grow as a developer. Whether itâ€™s through coursework or personal initiatives, I'm driven by a curiosity to push my technical skills further.

â˜• Big fan of coffee! When I'm not coding, you can often find me learning about different coffee brewing techniques and tasting new blends. Itâ€™s a hobby that keeps me energizedâ€”both literally and creatively!

ðŸŽ¸ Outside of tech, I love jamming on my guitar with friends. Music helps me balance my time away from the screen and keeps my creativity flowing in different ways.
